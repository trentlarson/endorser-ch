DB Schema Documentation for Endorser

This file exists to explain data because sometimes the comments inside the
.sqlite3 files need subsequent clarification or get outdated (and they can't
be edited after flyway has run).

The tables follow the snake-case convention (with underscores) while the
columns follow camelCase (with capital letters after the first word).
(We apologize for the inconsistency! Maybe we'll fix it in the future.)
