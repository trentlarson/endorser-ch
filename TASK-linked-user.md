# Users Who Can See DID Endpoint Checklist

## Implementation
- [x] Create new endpoint `/api/report/usersWhoCanSeeDid`
- [x] Accept required query parameters: `claimId` and `didProperty`
- [x] Validate input parameters
- [x] Retrieve claim from database
- [x] Extract target DID from claim property
- [x] Get all DIDs requester can see
- [x] Find paths to target DID for each visible DID
- [x] Calculate path lengths
- [x] Sort results by path length
- [x] Return formatted response

## Error Handling
- [x] Handle missing required parameters
- [x] Handle non-existent claim
- [x] Handle missing DID property in claim
- [x] Handle database errors
- [x] Handle network visibility errors

## Testing
- [ ] Unit Tests
  - [ ] Test with valid claim and DID property
  - [ ] Test with non-existent claim
  - [ ] Test with missing DID property
  - [ ] Test with missing parameters
  - [ ] Test with direct visibility path
  - [ ] Test with indirect visibility path
  - [ ] Test with multiple paths of different lengths
  - [ ] Test with no valid paths
  - [ ] Test with globally visible DID
  - [ ] Test with requester's own DID

- [ ] Integration Tests
  - [ ] Test complete visibility chain
  - [ ] Test with multiple users in visibility network
  - [ ] Test with circular visibility paths
  - [ ] Test with maximum path length
  - [ ] Test with rate limiting
  - [ ] Test with concurrent requests

## Documentation
- [x] Add Swagger documentation
- [x] Document response format
- [x] Document error responses
- [ ] Add example requests and responses
- [ ] Document performance considerations
- [ ] Document security considerations

## Performance
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed claims
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Add pagination for large result sets
- [ ] Add timeout handling for long-running queries
- [ ] Add request rate limiting

## Security
- [x] Validate user authentication
- [x] Respect visibility permissions
- [ ] Add input sanitization
- [ ] Add request size limits
- [ ] Add response size limits
- [ ] Add audit logging

## Monitoring
- [ ] Add performance metrics
- [ ] Add error rate monitoring
- [ ] Add usage statistics
- [ ] Add alerting for errors
- [ ] Add alerting for performance issues
