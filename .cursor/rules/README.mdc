- This service should be as simple as possible, while providing basic functionality for validation and reporting.

- This service should custody as little data as possible, encouraging the users to create and share signed data directly.

- At no point should this service be able to pretend to be any user. All activity should be verifiable by investigating the chain of transactions and the associated signatures.

- Extended functions, especially those that include other systems, should go in a separate path under "/api/partner" with data stored in a separate database.
